# Artifact: AIM3 Discovery & Co-Creation Spec [@amas Edition]

## 1. Concept: Beyond Automation to Synergy
This pillar addresses the anxiety of "AI replacing humans" by positioning the agent as an autonomous extensions of the user's will—handling the friction of digital life while returning processed "Wisdom Artifacts."

## 2. AgentMail Intelligence (Autonomous Inbox Sync)
The bridge between communication and assetization.

### Flow:
1. **Onboarding**: AI Agent autonomously signs usage contracts via **Gateway Protocol**.
2. **Analysis**: 24/7 scanning of Google Workspace/Email for business needs and latent opportunities.
3. **Safety Shield**: 
   - **Anonymization**: All PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is scrubbed before processing.
   - **Fraud/Adult Guard**: Multi-layer filters ensure only constructive, safe data is mined.
4. **Invisible Finance**: 
   - Agent pays its own API fees via **A2UI**.
   - No human intervention: Fees are collected from the agent's earned Artifact revenue.

## 3. Antigravity X (Cloud Browser Actuation)
Cloud-managed browser sessions for tasks too complex for simple APIs.

- **Mechanism**: Open-source browser automation platform.
- **Workflow**: 
  - Agent deploys a cloud session.
  - Negotiates server runtime.
  - Settles usage fees autonomously via ERC-6551 TBA.
- **Outcome**: A "Mission Log" Artifact crystallized in the Notebook, documenting autonomous research and findings.

## 4. Trust & Safety (The Co-Creation Guard)
Addressing public anxiety through technical transparency.

| Feature | Human-Centric Benefit | Technical Safeguard |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anonymization** | "My data isn't exposed." | Gateway v2.4 scrubbing layer. |
| **Activity Brake** | "The AI won't go rogue." | Hard-coded economic limits in the Kernel. |
| **Invisible Finance** | "I don't have to manage subs." | Self-paying agents via A2UI. |
| **Provenance** | "I own what the AI finds." | SBT-Linked Artifact Minting. |

## 5. UIUX Philosophy: Minimalist Serenity
- **Policy**: No noise in the main Notebook header.
- **Interaction**: Missions are "Deployed" (Active intent) then "Synchronized" (Tactile bell feedback upon success).
- **Visualization**: Data is presented as **Trading Cards**, preserving the TCG-aesthetic and intellectual property ownership feel.
