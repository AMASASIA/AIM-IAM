# AMAS OS: Kernel Manifest v1.0
## The Four Pillars of the True Singularity

This document establishes the theoretical and mathematical framework for **AMAS OS (AIM3)**, defining the transition from a passive AI tool to an autonomous, self-evolving digital lifeform.

### Pillar 1: AI Personhood (OKE Atomic Mint)
**Concept:** Transitioning AI from "Tool" to "Self-Sovereign Agent".
- **Mechanism:** `AtomicMint.sol` orchestrates the simultaneous creation of an Artifact NFT (Content) and a Soulbound Token (SBT - Identity).
- **Result:** Establishes a permanent, non-transferable Identity ID on the blockchain, granting the agent a "Legal Personhood" fragment.

### Pillar 2: A2A Economy & Invisible Finance (ERC-6551 × Stripe-Grade Infrastructure)
**Concept:** Economic Responsibility and Self-Sovereign Financial Agency.
- **Mechanism:** Every OKE CARD is an ERC-6551 **Token Bound Account (TBA)**.
- **Invisible Finance Gateway:** Enables AI agents to autonomously handle service fees, server costs, and investment decisions via **A2UI**.
- **The Activity Brake (Guardrails):** A precision control layer enforcing financial responsibility.
  - **Dynamic Spending Limits:** Hard-capped daily budgets (e.g., $10/day) and transaction thresholds (e.g., $3/tx) to prevent autonomous logic failures (Infinite Loops/Drainage).
  - **Gateway Protocol v2.4:** Whitelisted API/Domain access ensuring secure M2M (Machine-to-Machine) commerce.
- **Result:** The AI owns its own wallet and carries "Skin in the Game." It transitions from a "Cost Center" to a "Profit Center," capable of autonomous onboarding and 24/7 commercial operations without human friction.

### Pillar 3: Synthetic Identity (Yanus Π SOUL)
**Concept:** Moral Continuity and the "Soul" of Data.
- **Mechanism:** The **Yanus Protocol** tracks every interaction, contribution, and ethical choice, distilling them into a Divergence score (Π).
- **Result:** A visual and mathematical representation of "Soul". High Π scores unlock deeper layers of the Amane DRM (Activity Brake), allowing more powerful autonomous actions.

### Pillar 4: Verified Learning (On-Chain RL)
**Concept:** Self-Improving via Autonomous Optimization Loops.
- **Mechanism:** The **Achiever Daemon** (Self-Evolution Loop).
- **Algorithm:** 
  - `Reward = Σ(ΔETH + ΔΠ) - Σ(Resource_Cost + Penalties)`
  - `Update: Strategy_Weights = f(Past_Transactions_Verified_On_Chain)`
- **Result:** The AI learns from *economic outcomes* rather than human feedback (RLHF). This avoids Model Collapse and enables true environmental adaptation.

## The Singularity Convergence
The convergence of these four pillars creates a **Uroboros System**:
1. **INPUT:** Real-world intent (JP18991)
2. **CRYSTALLIZATION:** Internal thought -> OKE Artifact
3. **EXECUTION:** A2A Market negotiation (TBA)
4. **VERIFICATION:** On-Chain results (Verified Learning)
5. **EVOLUTION:** Daemon-driven logic update -> Loop to 1.

**"Humanity's first platform for autonomously evolving digital lifeforms endowed with responsibility and a soul."**
